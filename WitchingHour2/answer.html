        <p>A trembling voice replies: It's m-me Ca-Caitlyn. P-Please open the door, I'm scared.</p>
        <p>Zoe replies: I'll open the door, but first I need to know where my grandma is.</p> 
        <p>Caitlyn replies while sobbing: Please open the door Zoe, I'm begging you, I'm really scared.</p> 
        <p>Zoe insists: You have to tell me where my grandma is, or I won't let you in, if you're so scared, call the police.</p>
        <p>The entity on the other side bangs on the door and yells in a voice that sounds like Caitlyn but tinged with a demonic tone: Can you just open the fucking door Zoe?!</p>
        <p>Everyone in the room is petrified, and I'm sure everyone had the same feeling about the entity on the other side. It was ready to kill us.</p>
        <p>The evil entity on the other side continued to bang on the door, alternating between begging to be let in with Caitlyn's voice and demanding that we open the door in a demonic voice. </p>
