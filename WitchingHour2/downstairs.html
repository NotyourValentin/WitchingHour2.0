        <p>Zoe leaves the room to go downstairs. Once she leaves, you hear glass breaking and a muffled scream. Someone is coming upstairs, but you have a bad feeling. Tom opens the door and asks: Zoe? What happened?. You watch how an invisible force drags him outside the room while he screams and throws him to the wall. 
        </p>
        <p>You:</p>
