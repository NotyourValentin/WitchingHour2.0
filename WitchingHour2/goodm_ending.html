        <p>You and your friends held the dresser against the door until dawn. As the sun rose, you heard a demonic scream of agony, but you were too scared to leave the room.</p>
        <p>You stayed inside for a couple of hours until you heard Zoe's parents arrive and scream upon seeing the scene they found. They immediately called the police and ran upstairs to check on you.</p> 
        <p>Caitlyn's corpse was found in front of the bedroom door, half transformed in some kind of demonic witch, she had a gunshot wound on the side of her torso and had bled to death. Zoe's grandma was found dead downstairs, with several wounds all over her body. Close to her, they found a corpse of another half transformed demonic witch that kind of looked like Caitlyn's mom with long limbs and sharp teeth, killed by a gunshot to the head.</p>
