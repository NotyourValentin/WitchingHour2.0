        <p>Something was blocking the door to prevent you from leaving the room, so everyone starts attacking the witch by throwing everything they could find at her. All you can do is watch poor terrified Tom laying on the floor. As the witch walks towards Tom, she stands in front of the door, and you can see her a bit more clearly; her fingers are long and sharp like daggers, while looking at her hands you realize what she was chewing on... a heart. Your worst fear has been confirmed, and you scream to let the others know: She killed Zoe!</p> 
        <p>You can't watch her do the same to Tom, you have to do something:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="stuffed_toys.html">Throw stuffed toys at the witch to catch her attention.</a></li>
        <li><a href="porcelain_dolls.html">Grab Zoe's porcelain dolls and throw them at the witch.</a></li>
        <li><a href="you.html">Back To Previous Choice</a></li>
        <li><a href="index.html">Start Over</a></li>
        </ul>
