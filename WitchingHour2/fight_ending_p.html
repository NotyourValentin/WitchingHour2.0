        <p>As soon as she steps on the room, you grab one of Zoe's stuffed toys and throw it at her to catch her attention. She's angry, you try to hit her with the baton, but she lifts you in the air and throws you at the wall. Everything hurts, you're bleeding and can't stand up.</p>
        <p>You watch her grab Blythe by her head, Blythe is petrified and crying. The witch thrust her hand through Blythe's chest to eat her heart. After she's done with Blythe, she looks at you and lifts you by the neck. You're terrified and while your life is fading away, you can finally see her face and say your last words: â€¦ C-Caitlyn?</p>
